# APT source whitelist

This repo contains JSON files for the sources approved for addition in restricted build environments, specifically meant for the `apt` addon in travis-build.

At this moment, we're unable to continue processing the APT sources requests. If you require a new source, please use `duo: required`in your `.travis.yml` file. Thank you!
